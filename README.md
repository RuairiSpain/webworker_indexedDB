# Thought experiments with Webworker IndexedDB
Performance of postMessage() with WebWorker and IndexedDB 


Combine WebWorkders, JSON stringify and IndexedDB.  

Problem case:
postMessage is slow for large objects messages between workers.  Code investigates ways to use IndexDB to marshal data between worker threads.

ToDo:
Convert to JSON String
Convert to transferable Array (change ownership within threads, source thread loses scope of array)

Need to investigate other solutions from
